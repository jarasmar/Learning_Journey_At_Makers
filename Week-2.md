# Week 2 Goals
* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

_Plan to add improvements to my Airport Challenge to make it more consistent_

# Daily Goals

## Monday 24th February 2020
### MORNING GOAL
Code Review and set goals for the week

**Plan:**
Peer code review of the weekend challenge.

**Process:**
1. Make an apreciation.
2. Make a suggestion.
3. Make an improvement on your own code from the review you got. <br/>
(My peer suggested to creates doubles in my tests instead of create new instances of the class Plane, and I changed all those lines of my code to let it test independently in the Airport class.)

**What I've Learnt:**
>**Test Doubles:** any object that stands in for a real object during a test (think "stunt double"). You create one using the double method. When creating a double, you can allow messages (and settheir return values) by passing a hash.
```
plane = double("new plane")
```
