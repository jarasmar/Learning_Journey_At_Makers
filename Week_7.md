# Week  Goals

By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review
