# Week  Goals

By the end of the week all developers can:

- Build a front-end app in Javascript
- Work competently in Javascript 
- Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

This week is analogous to week 2 in that developers will be wrestling with some underlying language concepts that are not well understood (by Makers).

Most of the work and interventions we have run historically are meant to 'de-magic' Javascript and force developers to confront the pieces they are glossing over in an attempt to get work done.

# Daily Goals

## Monday 30th March 2020
### MORNING GOAL

Make a working plan for the week and start it.

**Plan:**

- First Half Morning: JS syntax in FreeCodeCamp
- Rest of the morning: Practicals
    - Asynchronous JS
    - Makers Pills:
      - Arrays
      - jQuery events 
      - Mocking
      - Front end single page app
    - JS Closures
    - Semicolons use

**Process:**

**Semicolons in JavaScript:**
- Required: when two statements are on the same line.
  ```javascript
  var i = 0; i++         // <-- semicolon obligatory
                        //     (but optional before newline)
  var i = 0            // <-- semicolon optional
  i++                 // <-- semicolon optional
  ```
- Optional: after statements (a piece of code that tells the computer to do something). It can be omitted if the statement is followed by a line break, like the example above.
- Avoid: after curly braces (except in a function definition)
  ```javascript
  // NO semicolons after }:
  if  (...) {...} else {...}
  for (...) {...}
  while (...) {...}

  // BUT:
  do {...} while (...);

  // function statement: 
  function (arg) { /*do this*/ } // NO semicolon after }
  ```
  
- Avoid: after the round bracket in an if, for, while or switch statement.
  ```javascript
  // After the ) changes the action completely:
  if (0 === 1); { alert("hi") }

  // equivalent to:

  if (0 === 1) /*do nothing*/ ;
  alert ("hi");
  ```
