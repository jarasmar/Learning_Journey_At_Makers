# Brief Tale of a Life Change

While In high school I decided I wanted to be a doctor, chose all the scientific subjects and studied to get the higher grades to join the very selective Medicine Universities. I did it, the grades. But then I changed my mind and decided to study Fine Arts. 

Sculpture, Photography, Engraving, a lot of travelling... I loved it, all of it, no regrets on the 'career change'. Three years in Spain, one in Italy, all of them passed incredibly fast. But all good things come to an end, and reality for graduated 'artists', specially in Spain or Italy, is that there's no jobs. 


Next year was up and down, travelling, living here and there and working in hospitality.
I then joined a cinema school for a couple of years and specialised in makeup, hair and special effects for cinema and theatre. After a long struggling in Madrid trying to find a job in this field I decided to move to London and try luck in this amazing city.

So there I was, in London again after so many years, seven no less. A new beginning, in a new-ish city. First things first, get a flat, then get any job to pay the bills. Mood check-in: not so happy about it, but seeing the big goal, theatre there we go. 

Few weeks later, I went into a (non very successful) date that luckily introduced me to Code. That blew my mind. A new career, a new field, so wide that offers endless possibilities. A chance to learn amazing new things and still be able to combine them with my old art/design skills. A chance to leave all those boring and not stimulating jobs to contribute with my work to create a better world, to help people. Plus the possibility of eventually make my old dream come true: become a freelance (or remote) and work while travelling through the world. 

This is Spring 2019, my IT knowledge was reduced to restarting the laptop when it was not working properly. This Code thing sounds really scary. Am I really going to try? Yes.


# Learning Journey at Makers

This is my learning journey at Makers Academy. I started the online precourse 20th January 2020 and the onsite course in London 17th February. Unfortunately the school had to close due to Coronavirus crisis and we moved to a fully remote course one month later. This was challenging but add an extra value too, as it made us focus on knowdledge sharing amongst our cohort, online collaboration and pairing, ecc. Finally, 7th of May, is time for our Final Project Fair, and we are ready to start a new journey on our own.

This repository includes examples of my work, challenges completed, and the processes I have learnt and developed while working towards the following goals:

- **I can make Software:**
  * Methodical approach to solving problems
  * Planning and Modelling
  * Test Driven Development
  * Debugging
  * Refactoring

- **I am equiped for long term growth:**
  * I manage my own wellbeing
  * I can learn anything by myself

- **I help my teams succeed:**
  * I use an agile product development process
  * I write code that is easy to change
  * I can justify the way I work
  * I grow collaboratively

## My Makers Journal

During my 12 weeks at Makers Bootcamp I have grown up both as a person and as a developer. 

The table below has a summary of the following contents:
- Goals: every week was designed to covered different knowdledge areas.
- Projects: most of them are done in the afternoons, pairing with a different colleage everyday. (Weeks 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 are group projects. Week 10 is individual work)
- Weekend Challenges: designed to be done individually and to reinforce the knowdlege acquired during the week.
- Journal: every day I wrote about my learning and challenges while at Makers. Descriptions of the projects and end of the week reflections.
