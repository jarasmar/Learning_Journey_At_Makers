# Engineering Projects Weeks

Work in teams to produce a social media platform: Acebook, a clone of Facebook.

Each team will start with the same project seed and virtual card-wall with some initial tickets to get you started. When completed, ask the coaches for more!

At the end of the project, each team will present the great work done! They will talk through a very s
imple slide deck and do a quick demo of their project. Communicate about your learning, technical achievements, and show off your cool project to the rest of your cohort.

### Working as a group

We spend the first day mostly planning and organizing the two weeks ahead of us:

- Daily schedule:
  - 9.30am daily standup: decide on the tasks for the day and split the work in pairs
  - 2pm lunch briefing: mood checks, working flow checks
  - 5pm retro: explain the work of the day to the other members, merge branches, update online tools, reflections
  
- Team roles rotation:
  - Each member of the group had a different role every day
  - Roles: Technician, Scrum Master, Leader, Scribe
  
- Pairs rotation:
  - Every day we worked in a different pair
  
- Online tools:
  - [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/adiRFheq/the-undefined-method)
  - Miro Board
  - Google Docs
  - Slack
  - Zoom

- Knowledge Sharing:
  - Most of the technologies we were using were new to all of us. 
  - Sometimes the pairs were working in different areas we focused a lot on sharing every new information we got. 
  - We used a special section in our Trello Board for this: 'Learning Resources' were we saved links to interesting references organized by technology.
