# Week 1 Goals
* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

# Daily Goals

## Tuesday 18th February 2020
#### GOAL 1
Learn some Debugging Techniques

**Plan:** 
Attend Debugging workshop and work through the challenges.

**Process:**
Debug a program by finding and fixing three bugs
- One was a reasonably simple typo in the file (t1tle instead of title)
- The second was again a typo, calling a wrong method this time (.includes? instead of .include?) 
- The third one threw a NameError message (undefined variable) and it was coming from one of the project gems (one of the methods was returning nil).

**What I've Learnt:**
>Mantra for Debugging: 
>- Tighten the loop (find the _exact line_ the bug is coming from)
>- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
>- Once you know the one thing that is wrong, try to fix it.

_(Hint: Start from the first line of the error and check the paths, as it may not be caused in the main file but in a secondary one, a gem...)_

#### GOAL 2
Practice Pairing and Test-Drive

**Plan:** 
Pair with Karla and start working through the afternoon challenge for the week "Boris Bikes".

**Process:**
1. Set up a project in which we could both collaborate via GitHub
2. Work with _User Stories_ and transform them into _Domain Models_.
3. Move from _Domain Models_ to a _Feature Test_ and investigate on the error.
4. Use Rspec to make an _Unit Test_ out of the _Feature Test_.
5. Pass your first test with the help of the _Stack Trace_.
6. Go back to feature and implement it. (_Add a Variable to the existent Class_)
7. Update the Unit test for the new feature. (_Add an "it" to the "describe"_)

**What I've Learnt:**
>**User Stories:** describe each thing the program is expected to do from the perspective of an user. 

>**Domain Models:** diagram that shows how objects within a system use messages to communicate with one another. (_Process: write down all the nouns and verbes in the user story and organize them into Objects and Messages in a table_)

>**Feature Test:** taking the information from the Domain Model for a feature you need to figure out how this Objects and Messages will work together in the code (_Process: test it in IRB_).

>**Stack Trace:** all the lines that get printed when an error is thrown. Gives information about the type of error and all the paths to the different places of the code where it has happened.
