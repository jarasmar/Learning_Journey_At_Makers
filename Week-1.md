## Daily Goals

#### Tuesday 18th February 2020
* GOAL 1: Learn some Debugging Techniques
PLAN: Attend Debugging workshop and work through the challenges.

EVIDENCE:
Mantra for Debugging: 
- Tighten the loop (find the _exact line_ the bug is coming from)
- Get visibility (use `p` to inspect everything to help you home in on the exact line)
- Once you know the _one thing_ that is wrong, out of place, misspelled, or not giving you what you expect, try to fix it.
(Hint: Start from the first line of the error, as you may see in the path it is not caused in the main file but in a secondary one, a gem...)
* GOAL 2: Practice Pairing
