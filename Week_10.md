# Week Goals

- Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
- Develop a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.
- Solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code (well tested, easy to read and easy to change).

This week, you'll work solo to complete different technical challenges. A self assessment form will help you reflect on the quality of your code, and coaches will review your code once you believe you have achieved professional quality.
