# Week Goals

- Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test.
- Develop a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.
- Solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code

_By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change._
